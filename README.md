# Latent Bayesian Neural ODE Tutorial
My lecture notes at [Nordic Probabilistic AI School 2022](https://probabilistic.ai/). The lecture content is under [this notebook](./NODE.ipynb) (the notebook does not render on browser due to its size). 

- Requires `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`, `Pillow`, `torch`, `torchdiffeq`, `torchvision`.
- [This folder](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AoCg_EHL_pqdkMZooAyxfHJ1b_uR5A?e=NbZTc2) contains trained models, datasets and visualizations. You should place `etc` folder insinde this repo.
